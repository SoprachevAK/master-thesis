The master’s thesis titled "Development and Architectural Features of PolyMap: A Platform for Designing and Publishing Interactive Indoor and Outdoor Maps. Application of the Serverless Approach" is devoted to the creation of the cloud-based PolyMap platform for designing and publishing interactive maps of facilities and adjacent areas.

The methodology is based on the use of serverless architecture and a microservice approach, which ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and reduced operational costs. A web application for interactive map viewing was developed, optimized for performance and energy efficiency, and adapted for various user devices.

The results of the research include the design and implementation of the serverless PolyMap architecture, integration with modern cloud services, as well as the introduction of automation tools (CI/CD), SEO optimization, and software quality assurance.

The results are applicable to the digitalization of infrastructure for universities, museums, events, and other facilities requiring interactive navigation.

In conclusion, the use of the serverless approach in PolyMap’s architecture enables high performance, flexibility, and commercial efficiency of the platform.
